This is a UI for an LNBITS wallet that's meant to look like a console from the tv show Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Grab your admin key from an LNBITS wallet and plug it in your environment variables as the value and REACT_APP_X_API_KEY as the key. Then, take a moment to reflect on the fact that I'm accepting no liability for all the money you're going to lose from using this app. Ruminate on it day and night and go on a fast if you don't feel as if you fully apprectiate how silly it would be to put any significant amount of money in here. Then, have fun recieving and sending real sats while LARPing as a crew member aboard an Enterprise grade starship.

Big thanks to plebdevs.com and their plebdev course, where I learned how to make lightning wallets!

FAQs


(I)  - Is this wallet 
safe? 
 
 - Absolutely 
not! I am still 
learning how to 
code and you are 
just one big ‘ol 
doofus if you put 
any significant 
amount of money 
in this wallet. 


(II) - How did you make this if you don’t fully know how to 
code? 
 
 - I took the bizarrely affordable plebdev course by 
pleblab. 


(III) - Isn’t the whole economic ideology of Star Trek 
antithetical to the mission of bitcoin? 
 
 - please chill out and don’t be such a downer.  It’s healthy 
to be challenged by contrary ideas. Plus, there are many 
other great themes in the show that are thought provoking.
